/*
NOTE:
When rear, gets to the end of the array, it wraps around to 0. 
And thatâ€™s where we run into a tricky part. 
If we keep adding elements to the queue, eventually front wraps around and catches up with rear. 
But if front == rear, we would incorrectly conclude that the queue was empty.
Hence an extra element.

/*
Why is cond_wait inside a for loop rather than an if statement; that is, why do we have to check the condition again after returning from cond_wait?
The primary reason you have to re-check the condition is the possibility of an intercepted signal. 
Suppose Thread A is waiting on nonempty. Thread B adds an item to the queue and signals nonempty.
Thread A wakes up an tries to lock the mutex, but before it gets the chance,
Evil Thread C swoops in, locks the mutex, pops the item from the queue, and unlocks the mutex. Now the queue is empty again, but Thread A is not blocked any more.
Thread A could lock the mutex and returns from cond_wait. If Thread A does not check the condition again, it would try to pop an element from an empty queue, and probably cause an error.
